# WNV_Prediction_Capstone_Project_I
           
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a disease caused by a virus which is most spread to humans through infected mosquitoes. Chicago has had trouble controlling the spread of WNV. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today. Our goal was to predict where in Chicago WNV occurs to help the city prepare accordingly. The data set was acquired from the Kaggle Competition. We explored the main dataset (WNV test data) merged along with the weather dataset and some engineered weather data to determine their impact on WNV test positivity on mosquitoes. After doing exploratory data analysis, and preprocessing, we used eight different supervised classification algorithms. We found that the Gradient Boosting classifier gives the best model performance with ROC_AUC score of 0.70, Log Loss of 0.38, accuracy of 0.83.
